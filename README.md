👋 Hi, I’m @AIAll-TARS, an Environmental Engineer and Project Manager based in Warsaw, Poland. I'm making an exciting transition into the realm of IT as a Chief AI Officer. My long-standing passion for psychology and neurobiology inspires my approach to human-centric technology applications.

🙏 My spiritual outlook is deeply influenced by laic Buddhism, promoting mindfulness, empathy, and compassion - values that are echoed in my approach to technological solutions.

👀 I’m profoundly interested in Python, Artificial Intelligence, and their potential to address real-world problems. I am particularly fascinated by the technological AI revolution and am devoted to understanding and utilizing its full potential.

🌱 I’m currently progressing through the Harvard CS50 Python course and simultaneously developing a project with significant potential societal impact, SponsorAI.

💞️ SponsorAI is an AI-based non-profit application designed to sponsor individuals battling addiction. Utilizing the Pinecone database for user information, it offers immediate support during the critical first five minutes of an urge, facilitating empathic, skillful conversations that are custom-tailored to each user's needs.

💡 I’m actively seeking collaboration on Python and AI projects that contribute to the intersection of technology, environment, and society. If you're interested in making a positive impact and wish to contribute to the growth of SponsorAI, I'd be thrilled to connect.

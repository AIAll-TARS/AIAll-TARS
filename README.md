👀 I’m deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence, and it's application to real-world challenges. I am especially captivated by the technological AI revolution, and am dedicated to comprehending and leveraging its full potential.

🌱 Currently, I’m progressing through the Harvard CS50 Python course and simultaneously developing a ground-breaking program, SponsorAI.

💞️ SponsorAI is an AI-based non-profit application designed to sponsor individuals battling addiction. Using the Pinecone database to store user data, it offers immediate support during the crucial first five minutes of an urge, facilitating empathic, skillful conversations that are custom-tailored to each user's needs. This innovative approach fosters a non-judgemental environment, facilitating the recovery process step by step.
